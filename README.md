# 🔥 OpenChat

**Important disclaimer:**
> :warning: **This project is not production ready, meant for local environment at this early stage, We quickly built this project to validate the idea, so please excuse any shortcomings in the code. You may come across several areas that require enhancements, and we truly appreciate your support by opening issues, submitting pull requests, and providing suggestions.**

---- 
OpenChat is an everyday user chatbot console that simplifies the utilization of large language models. With the advancements in AI, the installation and usage of these models have become overwhelming. OpenChat aims to address this challenge by providing a two-step setup process to create a comprehensive chatbot console. It serves as a central hub for managing multiple customized chatbots.

> Currently, OpenChat supports GPT models, and we are actively working on incorporating various open-source drivers that can be activated with a single click.




## Try it out:
**You can try it out on [openchat.so](http://openchat.so/)**

## 🏁 Current Features

- Create unlimited local chatbots based on GPT-3 (and GPT-4 if available).
- Customize your chatbots by providing PDF files, websites, and soon, integrations with platforms like Notion, Confluence, and Office 365.
- Each chatbot has unlimited memory capacity, enabling seamless interaction with large files such as a 400-page PDF.
- Embed chatbots as widgets on your website or internal company tools.
- Use your entire codebase as a data source for your chatbots (pair programming mode).
- And much more!

## 🛣️ Roadmap:
- [x] Create unlimited chatbots
- [x] Share chatbots via URL
- [x] Integrate chatbots on any website using JS (as a widget on the bottom right corner)
- [x] Support GPT-3 models
- [x] Support vector database to provide chatbots with larger memory
- [x] Accept websites as a data source
- [x] Accept PDF files as a data source
- [x] Support multiple data sources per chatbot
- [x] Support ingesting an entire codebase using GitHub API and use it as a data source with pair programming mode
- [x] Support pre-defined messages with a single click
- [ ] Support Slack integration (allow users to connect chatbots with their Slack workspaces)
- [ ] Support Intercom integration (enable users to sync chat conversations with Intercom)
- [ ] Support offline open-source models (e.g., Alpaca, LLM drivers)
- [ ] Support Vertex AI and Palm as LLMs
- [ ] Support Confluence, Notion, Office 365, and Google Workspace
- [ ] Refactor the codebase to be API ready
- [ ] Create a new UI designer for website-embedded chatbots
