5. Once the vulnerability or issue is resolved, we will credit you for your contribution, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Please note that we appreciate your efforts to maintain responsible disclosure. We kindly request that you do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities or issues until we have addressed them.

## Supported Versions

The security policy applies to the latest stable version of the project. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are using an up-to-date version to benefit from security enhancements and bug fixes. Older versions might not receive immediate attention or support for reported vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Response

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and efficiently. Once we receive a security report, we will follow these steps:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within 1 business days.
2. Investigate and validate the reported vulnerability or issue.
3. Develop a plan to resolve the vulnerability or issue.

5. Release a patch or update that addresses the vulnerability or issue.
6. Provide the reporter with feedback and credit (if requested) after the vulnerability is resolved.

The timeframe for the above steps may vary depending on the complexity of the issue and other factors. We will strive to keep you informed about the progress and any necessary actions.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors, maintainers, and users of this repository to adhere to our Code of Conduct. This ensures a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone involved. The Code of Conduct can be found in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file.

## Dependencies

This repository may utilize third-party libraries and dependencies. While we strive to keep them updated, it is essential to be aware of potential vulnerabilities in these dependencies. We encourage contributors and users to regularly review and update dependencies to incorporate security patches and improvements.

## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security and integrity of the repository, we recommend following these best practices:

1. **Strong Authentication**: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your GitHub account to add an extra layer of security.
2. **Secure Credentials**: Avoid committing sensitive information, such as passwords, access tokens, or API keys, to the repository. Utilize environment variables or secure storage solutions for handling sensitive data.
3. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep your local repository up to date by pulling the latest changes frequently.
5. **Code Review**: Encourage peer code reviews to identify security vulnerabilities, logic flaws, or potential issues.
6. **Secure Communications**: Use encrypted connections (HTTPS) when communicating with the repository and avoid using insecure or public networks.
7. **Access Control**: Ensure appropriate access controls and permissions are set for collaborators or contributors.
8. **Testing**: Implement a robust testing strategy to identify and fix security issues in the early stages of development.
9. **Security Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the repository for any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

These practices aim to mitigate common security risks and maintain the overall security posture of the repository.
